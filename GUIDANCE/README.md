## Keeping This Folder Current
- Update the relevant guide whenever you change build scripts, adapters, or UI entry points.
- Cross-link deeper design docs that live in `/docs` rather than duplicating longform research here.
- When adding new subsystems (e.g., governance, analytics) create a numbered guide to document it.
