# 08 â€” Security & Operations

## Security Architecture Overview

The GIVE Protocol implements a defense-in-depth security model with multiple layers of protection:

## Design Principles

### 1. **Defense in Depth**
- **Multi-layer security**: Access control + contract-level + operational + monitoring
- **Fail-safe defaults**: Operations fail securely when conditions are not met
- **Principle of least privilege**: Minimal permissions for each role and function
- **Separation of concerns**: Isolated contract responsibilities with clear boundaries

### 2. **Campaign-First Security Model**
- **Campaign isolation**: Each campaign has dedicated vault with isolated risk exposure
- **Permissionless submissions**: ETH staking mechanism prevents spam and ensures commitment
- **Curator approval**: Human review process for campaign validation and quality control
- **Yield protection**: User funds generate yield safely while maintaining campaign allocation flexibility

### 3. **Economic Security**
- **Protocol fee sustainability**: 20% fee ensures ongoing security operations and development
- **Stake-based commitment**: Campaign creators must stake ETH, creating skin-in-the-game incentives
- **Yield allocation flexibility**: Users control 50%, 75%, or 100% allocation to campaigns
- **Treasury management**: Protocol fees fund security audits, bug bounties, and infrastructure

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Core Security Roles

| Role | Permissions | Security Considerations |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| `CAMPAIGN_ADMIN` | Approve/reject campaigns, manage campaign lifecycle | **High Risk** - Multi-sig required, time delays on critical operations |
| `STRATEGY_ADMIN` | Create yield strategies, manage adapters | **High Risk** - Controls yield generation, requires technical expertise |
| `KEEPER` | Execute automated tasks, trigger distributions | **Medium Risk** - Automated operations, rate limiting recommended |
| `CURATOR` | Review campaign submissions, quality control | **Medium Risk** - Subjective decisions, transparent processes needed |
| `VAULT_OPS` | Vault management, emergency operations | **High Risk** - Direct fund access, strict monitoring required |
| `TREASURY` | Protocol fee management, treasury operations | **Critical Risk** - Treasury access, hardware wallet mandatory |
| `GUARDIAN` | Emergency pause, security incident response | **Critical Risk** - System-wide control, incident response team only |
| `DONATION_RECORDER` | Record and track donations | **Low Risk** - Read-only operations, audit trail maintenance |

### Access Control Implementation

```solidity
// Centralized role management through RoleManager
contract SecurityPatterns {
    // Multi-role validation for critical operations
    modifier onlyAuthorizedRoles(bytes32[] memory roles) {
        bool authorized = false;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < roles.length; i++) {
            if (roleManager.hasRole(roles[i], msg.sender)) {
                authorized = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        require(authorized, "Unauthorized: insufficient role permissions");
        _;
    }
    
    // Time-delayed critical operations
    modifier withTimeDelay(bytes32 operationId, uint256 delay) {
        require(timeDelays[operationId] != 0, "Operation not scheduled");
        require(block.timestamp >= timeDelays[operationId] + delay, "Time delay not met");
        _;
        delete timeDelays[operationId];
    }
}
```

## Smart Contract Security

### Critical Vulnerabilities & Mitigations

#### 1. **Reentrancy Protection**
```solidity
// All external calls protected with ReentrancyGuard
function distributeToAllUsers(address asset, uint256 totalYield) 
    external 
    nonReentrant 
    whenNotPaused 
    returns (uint256) 
{
    // Implementation with external calls protected
}
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuard` on all vault operations
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern throughout
- State updates before external calls
- Reentrancy testing in all test suites

#### 2. **Access Control Bypass**
```solidity
// Centralized permission checking
function _checkAuthorization(bytes32 role, address account) internal view {
    if (!roleManager.hasRole(role, account)) {
        revert Errors.UnauthorizedCaller(account);
    }
}
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Centralized `RoleManager` contract for all permissions
- Custom error types for clear failure modes
- Role hierarchy validation and inheritance
- Regular access control audits

#### 3. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**
```solidity
// Solidity 0.8.20+ built-in overflow protection
// Additional validation for critical calculations
function calculateYieldDistribution(uint256 totalYield) internal pure returns (uint256, uint256) {
    require(totalYield > 0, "Invalid yield amount");
    uint256 protocolFee = (totalYield * PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS) / BASIS_POINTS;
    require(protocolFee <= totalYield, "Fee calculation overflow");
    return (protocolFee, totalYield - protocolFee);
}
```

#### 4. **External Protocol Risk**
```solidity
// Adapter isolation and safety checks
contract AaveAdapter {
    function supply(uint256 amount) external override {
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
        require(amount <= maxSupplyAmount, "Exceeds supply limit");
        
        // Safety check before external call
        uint256 balanceBefore = asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        
        try aavePool.supply(address(asset), amount, address(this), 0) {
            uint256 balanceAfter = asset.balanceOf(address(this));
            require(balanceBefore - balanceAfter == amount, "Supply amount mismatch");
        } catch {
            revert Errors.ExternalProtocolError();
        }
    }
}
```

### Circuit Breakers & Emergency Controls

#### Pausable Operations
```solidity
// Granular pause controls
contract EmergencyControls is Pausable {
    bool public investingPaused;
    bool public harvestingPaused;
    bool public distributionsPaused;
    
    modifier whenInvestingNotPaused() {
        require(!investingPaused, "Investing paused");
        _;
    }
    
    function emergencyPauseAll() external onlyRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE) {
        _pause();
        investingPaused = true;
        harvestingPaused = true;
        distributionsPaused = true;
        emit EmergencyPauseActivated(msg.sender, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```
