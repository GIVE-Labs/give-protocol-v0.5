# GIVE Protocol ‚Äì No-Loss Donations Powered by DeFi

> **The Future of Giving**: Stake your assets, fund social impact with yield, keep your principal forever.

GIVE Protocol is creating a **no-loss donation platform powered by DeFi and blockchain**.

Think of us as a **Web3 version of GoFundMe or Kickstarter**. Instead of donating your capital, we allow users to stake assets into DeFi vaults, and use the generated yield to fund good causes and early-stage projects - **all without losing their capital**.

Every donation is **on-chain, transparent, and ensures recipient accountability**.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED TO BASE SEPOLIA** (October 2025)  
**Network:** Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532) | [View Deployment ‚Üí](./DEPLOYMENT.md)

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Supporters Stake Assets** - Deposit WETH into campaign-specific vaults
2. **Auto-Investment** - 99% of deposits flow to yield-generating DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound)
3. **Yield Distribution** - Harvested profits split between campaigns and supporters
4. **Principal Safe** - Withdraw your original deposit anytime
5. **Transparent Tracking** - All donations on-chain with campaign milestones

### Core Components

**Governance Layer**
- **ACLManager** - Role-based access control for all protocol operations
- Multisig + Timelock governance model

**Campaign Management**
- **CampaignRegistry** - Campaign lifecycle (submission ‚Üí approval ‚Üí active ‚Üí completed)
- **StrategyRegistry** - Risk tiers and adapter configurations
- **VaultFactory** - Deploy ERC-4626 vaults for each campaign

**Vault System**
- **CampaignVault4626** - ERC-4626 compliant vaults with auto-investment
- **YieldAdapters** - Integrations with Aave, Compound (Morpho, Yearn coming soon)
- 99% auto-invested, 1% cash buffer for instant withdrawals

**Distribution**
- **PayoutRouter** - Yield distribution to campaigns and supporters
- **Checkpoint Voting** - Supporters vote on campaign milestones
- Failed checkpoints halt payouts until resolved
