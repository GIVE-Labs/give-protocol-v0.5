# GIVE Protocol â€“ No Loss Giving, Modular v0.5

The GIVE Protocol redirects on-chain yield to social impact campaigns without touching a donor's principal. Depositors receive ERC-4626 vault shares, their assets flow through yield adapters, and harvested profits are streamed to vetted NGOs. The v0.5 overhaul keeps this no-loss promise while reorganising the stack around UUPS proxies, shared storage, and ACL-managed governance.

### Core Architecture Principles

- **Governance:** Multisig + Timelock â†’ ACLManager issues role-based permissions for all protocol operations
- **Campaign-Centric:** Each campaign gets its own ERC-4626 vault deployed by the factory with strategy-specific risk parameters
- **Auto-Investment:** 99% of deposits automatically flow to yield adapters (Aave, Compound), 1% kept as cash buffer
- **Yield Distribution:** PayoutRouter splits harvested yield between campaigns (default 80%) and supporters (default 20%)
- **Checkpoint Voting:** Supporters vote on campaign milestones; failed checkpoints halt payouts until resolved
- **Upgradeability:** All core contracts use UUPS proxies controlled by ACL's `ROLE_UPGRADER`
- **Shared Storage:** Module libraries (VaultModule, AdapterModule, etc.) operate on a single storage struct via `StorageLib`

**Principal Protection:** User deposits remain withdrawable at all times (subject to optional lock periods). Only yield flows to campaigns.

**For full technical details**, see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - includes governance flows, emergency procedures, and security model.

## Repository Layout
```
backend/                          Foundry workspace for Solidity contracts and tests
  src/                            Modular architecture (types, storage, modules, adapters, vault, governance)
  test/                           Foundry test suites (ACL, adapters, vault flows, donation router, synthetic assets)
frontend/                         Legacy UI (kept for reference during migration)
OVERHAUL_PLAN.md                  Phase-by-phase development checklist
SECURITY_REMEDIATION_ROADMAP.md   Security audit fixes and implementation guide
```

Legacy contracts that still live in `backend/src` will be removed once their replacements graduate through the plan.

**Note:** The `docs/` directory has been cleaned up. Phase-specific documentation has been integrated into code comments and the main planning documents.

---

## Development Workflow
1. **Align with the Plan**
   - Confirm the next unchecked item in `OVERHAUL_PLAN.md`.
   - Document deviations directly in the plan before implementing them.
2. **Build & Test**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   forge build
   forge test
   ```
   Tests are being ported phase-by-phase; expect incomplete coverage until later phases.
3. **Validate Roles & Access**
   - Route all state through `StorageLib`.
   - Gate mutations with ACL-managed roles; avoid bespoke ownership checks.
4. **Document as You Go**
   - Prefer concise in-code comments for non-obvious logic.
   - Update this README and the plan whenever architecture-level assumptions shift.

---

## Contribution Principles
- **Preserve Principal:** Never draft changes that move depositor principal. Yield distributions must originate from adapter profit.
- **Proxy Safety:** Every upgradeable contract must implement `_authorizeUpgrade` tied to the ACL Upgrader role.
- **Deterministic Deployments:** Scripts and tests should keep deployment order and addresses reproducible.
- **Modularity First:** New features belong in modules, adapters, or libraries rather than monolithic contracts.

---

## Legacy Surface (Reference Only)
The original MVP commands exist purely for comparison and are not maintained:
```bash
# Contracts (legacy surface)
cd backend
forge build
forge test

# Frontend prototype
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Use these only when auditing regressions against historical behaviour.

## Getting Started Checklist
1. Read `OVERHAUL_PLAN.md` through Phase 12.
2. Explore `backend/src/types` and `backend/src/storage` to understand the shared memory model.
3. Deploy `GiveProtocolCore` and `ACLManager` in a local Foundry test to experiment with role gating.
4. Coordinate with the team before modifying governance, storage slots, or payout math.

The goal of this rebuild is a transparent, upgrade-safe protocol that donors, NGOs, and auditors can trust. Keep the codebase and documentation razor sharp.
